libdrawtext
===========

About
-----
Libdrawtext is a simple library for fast anti-aliased text rendering in OpenGL.

Since version 0.3 libdrawtext can also render text on plain RGBA pixel buffers.

Libdrawtext uses freetype2 for glyph rasterization. If you would rather avoid
having freetype2 as a dependency, you can optionally compile libdrawtext
without it, and use pre-rendered glyphmaps. Glyphmaps can be generated by the
included font2glyphmap tool, or by calling `dtx_save_glyphmap`.

See examples subdir for simple programs demonstrating libdrawtext usage, and
refer to the heavily commented drawtext.h header file.
